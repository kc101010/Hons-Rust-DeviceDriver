The driver within 'Rust Hello', `rust_mouse.rs`, was developed on an Ubuntu Virtual Machine running under VirtualBox using Rust. Its makefile is included and can be used to build the driver into executable form.

The driver within 'Rust Character', `rust_char.rs`, was developed on Linux + Busybox instance running via QEMU. The driver was built alongside the driver samples therefore no makefile is included.
